- The roster is the file the dispatcher keeps of the agents it dispatched, at `~/.playground/roster.json` (in `$PLAYGROUND_DATA_DIR` when it is set).
  `api/hono/src/lib/dashboard/roster.ts` is its one reader, which any dashboard code that needs the roster imports: `rosterSchema` (zod), and `readRoster()`, cached by the file's mtime, which returns `{ problem, roster }`.
  The one exception is `rosterAgents()` in `cmux.ts`, which reads the file raw for `cmuxHeld()`, as the hooks read it, since a factory session the hooks place must still hold cmux when `readRoster()` would drop its agent (a kind-only one) or the whole roster (one with no `updatedAt`).
  Each agent is checked on its own and every fault is named in `problem`, an ended row's excepted: an optional key off its schema (a title over 40 characters, a malformed time) is ignored and the agent kept, a bad required key drops that agent alone, a missing file is no roster and no problem, and one that cannot be read (a directory, no permission) is a problem rather than an error.
  The dispatcher and its leads write it, only through `scripts/roster.ts` in the main checkout; the dashboard only reads it.
  Its shape, keys A to Z, unknown keys ignored, times ISO 8601 with an offset (`date -u +%FT%TZ`), optional keys omitted when unknown:

  `name` (the session's full name), `role` (`manager`, `worker` or `runner`), `status` (one word from `scripts/roster-statuses.json`, which roster.ts checks on every write) and `task` are required; `title` is the triaged task title, at most 40 characters.
  `kind` says what the session is, whatever its name: one of `ROSTER_KINDS` in `packages/config/src/kinds.ts` (builder, dispatcher, ops, optimizer, planner, probe, researcher, reviewer, runner, tester, worker), which spawn.sh writes at every start;
  `roleOf` in `workers.ts` places a session by it before its name's prefix (a dispatcher by its name still, a probe in Other), and an unknown kind is named and ignored, the agent kept.
  `slot` is a dispatcher's slot, `2` for the second (Bravo), which spawn.sh writes for a second `<id>-dispatcher` and `roster.ts who dispatcher` reads.
  `eta` is when a worker expects its chore done, the time it last sent its lead (playbook's **eta** rule); the sidebar row's tooltip counts down to it on a worker that is working, fixing or stuck (`timeLeft` in `web/next/src/lib/agents.ts`), showing nothing once it passes, once its pull request is merged or while it sits paused on a usage limit,
  and one that is not a time is named and ignored.
  `backlog` lists what is queued for the next free agent, in the order it was queued, and only grows (playbook's ROSTER.md says which entry a slot takes next): the lead that dispatches from it keeps two marks on its own entry,
  `backlogNext` (0-based, every entry below it settled) and `backlogTaken` (the indices at or past it settled already, dispatched out of turn, folded into a lane or dropped), each read as roster.ts writes it (`"5"`, `"3 7"`) or as a JSON number or array,
  from the builder's entry alone (`managerOf(agents, "builder")` in `packages/config/src/kinds.ts`, the rule `roster.ts who builder` prints, `builder` until a builder of another name is live), so a stray mark elsewhere hides nothing; with none, the cursor is 0 and nothing is taken.
  The dashboard shows the entries still waiting as Next up: `Fix: ` entries (live breakage or security), then `<PLAYGROUND_OWNER_NAME>: ` entries (what the owner asked for themself, `queued()` in `api/hono/src/lib/dashboard/agents.ts`), then the rest, each oldest first (a free slot takes a `Fix: ` entry, else an org's one, and the Planner folds the rest into its lanes);
  a backlog that is not a list of strings is named and read as empty.
  `schedule` is when a runner runs, `always` or a 5-field cron (`0 5 * * *`), which its sidebar row's tooltip holds.
  `ticket` (a Linear ID, such as `FIX-1234`) is the ticket the agent works on, which its sidebar row shows before its title.
  `worker` is a reviewer's or tester's own worker, by its full name, set when the worker spawns it, so its row nests under that worker whatever the two are named.
  `branch`, `repo` (`owner/name`) and `pr` (a GitHub pull request URL) say where the work went, and the dashboard uses them when the session is down, its checkout is on a default branch, or another live session shares its checkout; a session on a branch of its own shows that branch's pull request instead.
  `lastReport` and `lastReportAt` stand in for a report the transcript does not hold; the later of the two is shown, and a time more than five minutes ahead of the clock counts as none.
  A roster agent pairs with the live session of its name, or of that name without its role prefix (`worker-greed` with a session launched as `greed`), else with the one session in its `workspace` (`workspace:<n>`).
