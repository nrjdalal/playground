# Playground

Claude Code skills for an org's tickets, end to end, with the org's own skills in its extension.

## Language

**Run**:
One `/triage-and-implement` invocation, from its first turn until a marker ends it, the user starts a line with "work stop", or the user types `/triage-and-implement stop`.

**Status block**:
The summary that ends every turn of a run: the phase, the evidence for each step so far, and the next step.

**Marker**:
A line `✅ **Done** · …`, `⛔ **Blocked** · …` or `⏳ **Waiting** · …` that ends or pauses a run. The older `[work done]`, `[work blocked]` and `[work waiting]` still match.
_Avoid_: status line

**Keep-going hook**:
The Stop hook (triage-and-implement's `scripts/keep-going.py`, in the org's extension) that sends a run back to work until a marker ends it.

**Hand-off**:
Passing a ticket that is not ours to its owner instead of implementing it.

**Canary**:
Running a test against the old code to prove it goes red.

**Canary branch**:
ZeroStarter's integration branch: every PR squash-merges into `canary`, and a release promotes it to `main`.
_Avoid_: canary, alone (that is the red-first test)

**Promoted**:
A skill in `skills/playground/`: it gets README entries and a docs page.

**Sidebar**:
The dashboard's left column: the session groups, the dispatchers' first, the system icons in its header and the usage line in its footer.

**Chat**:
The dashboard's middle region: a session's stream with its composer, the chat on Playground's view and an agent's log elsewhere.

**Aside** (also **aside window**):
The dashboard's right half beside the chat: the Inbox, Pages and app tabs (on a phone they take the chat's place, with a tab bar at the bottom).
_Avoid_: side panel

**Board**:
linear's default scope: the shared Developers view in Linear, which holds the AI Platform, Data, DevOps and QA teams today.
_Avoid_: the org's board (its views also hold the product team)

**Intake rules**:
The four checks, owned by the `claim` skill, that decide whether a ticket is ours: team, assignee, in flight, owner now. linear applies them to the board, whose own query adds To do in the shared Bugs project.

**Owner now**:
Whoever is actively working on a ticket's area (its Linear project and its code paths) in the last 30 days. claim reads it live from the project, the code history and the ticket, never from a fixed list.
_Avoid_: owner domain

**Difficulty tier**:
claim's estimate of a ticket's size: T1 small, T2 medium, T3 large (a schema change, another service, a backfill, an integration, or a design decision first).

**Verdict**:
claim's answer for one ticket, its first line: `✅ **Ours**`, `❓ **Ask first**` or `👤 **Theirs**`. triage-and-implement acts on it in phase 1.

**Vault note**:
The 1Password Secure Note holding the org's secrets, read through its extension's vault skill, which never prints a value.

**Covering ticket**:
Another open ticket, outside the Labs team and not the owner's, whose description shows that finishing it would meet a ticket's expected result. When someone holds it, claim asks that person and only them; when no one does, it is noted so the two get linked.

**Mine**:
A 💻 row on the linear skill's board for one of the owner's own started tickets, with its PR, review score and CI, before the board's tickets (linear-scan's Find step 2, in the org's extension, says which go here and which on the 🧪 line).

**Claim**:
A file saying which Claude session (by its session id) is working a ticket, so no other session takes it (triage-and-implement's CLAIMS.md, in the org's extension).

**Inbox**:
Playground's list of what the factory needs from the owner and what the owner should know, beside the owner's chat on the Dashboard: one `inbox_item` row each in the dashboard's local Postgres, posted only with `bun run ask`, shown by its `#i<ref>` id. Its three kinds are a **decision** (a preview of exactly what Approve does: a Slack message, a ship, a new ticket, a delete, a schema, a budget, or a plain ask whose words say what its poster does, answered Approve, Deny or Archive, with an optional note; or a secret ask, answered with a value its card hands to a sink and keeps nowhere), a **draft** (a Slack message or Linear comment the owner edits, then sends or discards, or for a Slack message saves as a draft in Slack for the owner to finish) and an **update** (an outcome to read: merged, shipped, an alert, a finding or a decision made for the owner). It replaced the asks; the poster carries out the owner's answer and never waits on it (playbook's **ask** rule).

**One-way door**:
A choice whose undoing costs real rows, real money or someone else's trust, such as a breaking schema change, a budget or a new Linear ticket. Of the choices a session could make itself, only these go to the owner as an **Inbox** decision, the closed set being the **ask** rule's list ([ADR 0012](./.agents/adr/0012-the-factory-decides-two-way-doors.md)).

**Two-way door**:
A choice that can be undone: a design, an order, the scope inside an ask the owner approved. The factory picks it and records it in an ADR or on the issue, telling the owner with an Inbox update only when it changes what the owner sees or does ([ADR 0012](./.agents/adr/0012-the-factory-decides-two-way-doors.md)).

**Gate**:
The set of verdicts a PR's head must hold before pr:merge squashes it: code-review-loop's 5/5 and GitHub's `Audit, Lint, and Build` and `test` checks green ([playbook](./extensions/core/skills/playbook/SKILL.md), the **gate** rule).

**Lead**:
One of the two managers under the dispatcher that run the floor (the dashboard's and the roster's Manager): the Builder leads the workers, Ops the runners and the ops jobs. Every worker and runner reports to exactly one lead, and the leads report to the dispatcher ([playbook](./extensions/core/skills/playbook/SKILL.md)).

**Thread**:
One thing the owner asked about, followed until it is done however many sessions work on it: a `thread` row in the dashboard's local Postgres with a 4-character id, each transcript line it holds tagged with its `thread_id` ([ADR 0013](./.agents/adr/0013-threads-are-the-owners-and-live-in-the-dashboards-database.md)). A review thread on a PR, the conversation code-review-loop resolves, is a different thing and keeps that full name.

**Fixture**:
A made-up machine the dashboard reads on factory, test and `PLAYGROUND_FIXTURE` stacks: fake sessions in every state, their transcripts, roster and usage, written fresh into a stack's scratch folder when it starts (`api/hono/src/fixtures/dashboard.json`), shown under a Test data badge. A full-page screenshot of a fixture stack carries no real data, so screenshots come from one alone. A person's own clone, the live dashboard's branch and a `PLAYGROUND_LIVE_READS` stack read the live machine ([ADR 0008](./.agents/adr/0008-a-persons-stack-reads-their-own-machine.md)).

**Vibeground**:
A worktree's own stack the owner starts from the Inbox's Preview row, worked on beside the chat or in a tab of its own: its branch as it stands, on a copy of the live dashboard's database seeded by one `pg_dump`, so it shows real data while its migrations reach the copy alone. Stop removes the copy and keeps the worktree.

**Probe**:
A throwaway session named `<id>-probe`, or `probe-<what>` when started before, spawned for one test and closed by its spawner the moment the test is done.

**Sweep**:
A lead's regular check of its own agents, for a picker waiting, a permission prompt, silence with no report, a worker off its chore, or a session gone, each acted on and recorded.

**Dispatcher**:
The dispatcher's own session: it routes each task by role, a new ask through the Planner and then a lead (the Builder or Ops), a fast lane straight to a lead, and holds no task of its own, so the sidebar lists it in its header, above the session groups, with no group title, and `/dashboard` opens its chat. The live dashboard itself belongs to a runner ([playbook](./extensions/core/skills/playbook/SKILL.md)).

**Manager**:
A session that manages under the dispatcher: the Planner, the Builder and Ops, by default `planner`, `builder` and `ops` by name, or any agent the dispatcher's roster gives the manager role. The dashboard lists managers under Orchestrators, below the dispatcher rows in the sidebar's header, with their tasks, A to Z by roster title until the owner drags them into an order of the owner's choosing. The factory's rules call the Builder and Ops leads (Lead).

**Picker**:
The command (`playground picker`) by which a session's manager answers one permission prompt: it allows or denies only the call the session's stuck alert named, keyed to that call (packages/scripts/src/playground/picker.ts).

**Planner**:
The Planner's session, a manager: it does every research, deep dive, comparison and plan, through read-only research workers the Builder dispatches, and never builds, so it stays free for the next ask. It keeps the roadmap, `~/.playground/bundles/plan.json`, whose lanes the Builder dispatches from ([playbook](./extensions/core/skills/playbook/SKILL.md)).

**Brief**:
The file that spawns a session and binds it: the task, its steps and its Done-when, passed to `scripts/spawn.sh` as a path, from the templates in `scripts/briefs/` ([SESSIONS.md](./extensions/core/skills/playbook/SESSIONS.md#spawn)).

**Bundle**:
The issues and backlog entries that touch one surface, such as the sidebar or the chat, grouped by the Planner into one chore: one worker, one branch, one PR, one review loop and one tester pass per head, its tester driving the pages and files it names.

**Lane**:
One surface's line in the planner's plan, `bundles/plan.json` in the data folder: the work a bundle builds next, dispatched and ordered by the Builder.

**Worker**:
A session doing one bounded chore, named `<id>-worker` by `bun run name worker` ([SESSIONS.md](./extensions/core/skills/playbook/SESSIONS.md#spawn)), such as `k3m9px-worker`; one started before keeps its name, such as `worker-brave-otter` or `worker-wrath`. The dashboard lists them under Subagents, with any the roster calls a worker, and nests each reviewer and tester checking its pull request under it. A probe, or a session with any other name, goes to the dashboard's collapsed Other group.

**Runner**:
A dedicated long-running session named `<id>-runner`, or `runner-<adjective>-<noun>` or `runner-<sin>` when started before (or one the dispatcher's roster gives the runner role, such as a headless scan Ops runs), such as the one that keeps the dashboard on its branch's latest head. The dashboard lists runner sessions in an AI Runners group of their own, and the ops jobs that run as scripts with no session in a Scripts group after it.

**Roster**:
The file the dispatcher keeps of the agents it dispatched (`~/.playground/roster.json`): each one's kind, role, task, short title, ETA and where its work went. The dashboard reads it for its Agents table, its Next up list (the roster's backlog still waiting) and its sidebar's titles and ETAs; the dispatcher and the leads write it, only through `scripts/roster.ts`.

**Slot**:
One turn at a heavy run on this machine: `~/.playground/ops/run-slot.sh <name> -- <command>` takes a run slot by mkdir and gives it back however the run ends ([playbook](./extensions/core/skills/playbook/SKILL.md), the **slots** rule).

**Template**:
One message's shape, a file in the `templates/` folder of the org's extension's templates skill: frontmatter naming what it is for, where it goes, the skills that send it and its `{{variables}}`, then the message. The sending skill decides who gets it and what fills it; the template decides how it reads.
