// The one way into Playground's Inbox: `bun run ask new < item.json` posts a decision, a draft or an update and prints its id (its #iN tag on stderr); `edit <id|#iN> < item.json` replaces the poster's own item's title and preview in place until it closes, checked as new checks it; both fill `{now}` with the time they post at and refuse a measured or now time ahead of the clock, and a draft with no link, a public post's, whose text holds a work figure or an internal name (the public rule); `open [--from <session>] [--since <iso time>] [--until <iso time>] [--json]` lists the open items, oldest first, those posted in that window alone when given, each whole as one JSON line with --json, so a poster names one on the same thing rather than posting it twice; `get <id|#iN>` prints the item, the owner's answer included once given, and the option the owner picked on stderr, and `--ack` marks that answer read, so the Dashboard shows it reached the poster, closing a deny, a clear, a discard or a provided secret; `ack <id>` closes it once carried out, a go with `--link` (where it landed) or `--no-link "<why>"`; `settle <id>` closes the poster's own open item once it is decided another way; `resolve <id> --by <you>` closes the poster's own update once it has settled; `stale` lists the answers no poster has closed, for ops-sweep; `whatsapp <file>` records the owner's answer from WhatsApp, a file ops-wa wrote in its own folder (whatsapp-answer.ts); `example <kind>` prints an ask to start from, and `new` hints at that shape when an ask is one block of prose, labels no options, names a PR, a tracker ID or a commit with no link on its line, or holds a code line too wide for the card. See `.agents/dashboard/asks.md` for the fields.
const USAGE = `usage: bun run ask new [--thread <id>] < item.json
                                                posts an inbox item from JSON on stdin, prints its id
                                                options and approve/deny labels go in plain words (the plain-words skill)
                                                an ask's, a draft's or a slack decision's attachments name files on
                                                this Mac by absolute path; a draft's or a slack decision's go into
                                                its Slack link's thread on Send or Approve, before its words
                                                an update with text and attachments is a read-only card: it shows
                                                them as an ask does, with no Approve or Deny
                                                a secret ask names a key and a sink (a Vercel project, or a Keychain
                                                item such as yard); the owner's value goes to the sink, and get shows
                                                only when and each exit status, or saved
                                                an own decision names one Claude account's email in usage.accounts
                                                at a scope and the own flag Approve leaves it with; a key that names
                                                no Claude row there (a GLM label included) is refused
                                                an accept decision names one proposal (scope, kind, key, rev), and
                                                more lists up to 20 further ones, accepted after it in that order;
                                                Approve stops at the first that fails
                                                a guard decision names a key a guard reads, or an ops job's

                                                object, or an org's own job's whole row; Approve writes it at its
                                                scope, a part over the row there, and Settings > Jobs toggles a job
                                                and edits its config too
                                                --thread files it under that thread (bun run thread)

                                                a draft with no link is a public post's: one whose text holds a work
                                                figure or an internal name is refused (playground rules public)
