// The API with no database, which src/main.ts serves while POSTGRES_URL is unset: GET /api/health answers up with `setup: true` and no database, so playground's wait, ops-tick's watch and verify count the stack as up, GET /api/setup reads where setup stands, POST /api/setup/container starts a local container, GET /api/v1/onboard/checks answers the first run's checks with the database as setup stands and done false, since the done mark lives in the database, GET and POST /api/v1/onboard/fix/:id read and start the first run's fixes, the database's being Start a local container, and every other route is 404.
