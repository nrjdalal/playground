An apps change's Approve writes the owner's own desktop-owner-apps list, the login scope's, with the app added or removed, through the store's put with no role, and records its line under listed. A grant's Approve opens System Settings at the pane for its permission (Accessibility or Screen Recording) on this Mac, a stack reading the live machine alone, records its line under opened, and tells the poster to recheck the grant. A guard setting's Approve takes seen, and writes the setting at the card's scope in this machine's extensions, its value or none, which takes it back to its default, and records its line under set. An own account change's Approve takes seen, and sets or clears the own flag on the one Claude account its key names in usage.accounts at the card's scope, every other account as it was, and records its line under owned",
