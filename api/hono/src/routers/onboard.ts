// Onboarding in place of a login: the list of what Playground runs on, then the owner made and signed in with no password, and signed in again the same way when the cookie is lost. Same machine is the owner, as first run's setup already holds, so each route takes this machine's requests alone, and every write a trusted origin over loopback first (guardWrites, as every owner-rung router mounts it); finish makes the owner only while none exists, and sign-in signs in the one owner alone. The first run's fixes (lib/onboard/fix.ts) take this machine alone before an owner exists, and the owner's session after. The agent route's LocalAgent is never that owner. Local stacks only.
