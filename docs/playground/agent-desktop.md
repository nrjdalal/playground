## What it does

`agent-desktop` lets a session operate a desktop app, such as Finder, through the [agent-desktop](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-desktop) CLI, which reads and drives apps through the macOS accessibility tree.
The binary carries its own docs, matched to its version, so the skill sends the session to them and adds only what the binary cannot know: whether this Mac lets the session run it, and what stays yours.
Your desktop is your own screen, so the skill keeps every session headless, away from your own apps, and keeps what it saw on the screen out of anything it writes outside its session.

## When to reach for it

A session loads it on its own before any `agent-desktop` command, or when a task needs a desktop app driven.

| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The binary is missing, or a macOS grant is not given | Stops, and tells its manager the one action: Ops installs it, or you grant the permission in System Settings |
| Both are in place                                    | Loads the binary's own docs (`skills get desktop`, `skills get platform`), then works headless               |
| The task would touch one of your own apps            | Leaves the app alone                                                                                         |
| The task needs `--headed`                            | Hands it to you as one command to run with `!`                                                               |

## The grants

macOS asks you, not the session, for two permissions: Accessibility, which every task needs, and Screen Recording, which only a screenshot needs.
macOS gives them to the app that launches `agent-desktop`.
A factory session runs under the herdr server, not a terminal you opened, so herdr is most likely the app to grant; the first trial after your grant confirms it.
The session reads the grants with `agent-desktop permissions`, which never prompts, and leaves the commands that open System Settings or a prompt on your screen to you.

## It's working if

- A session on a Mac with no grant stops at its first step and names the permission to grant, rather than trying a command.
- Your pointer and focus stay where you left them while a session works.
- The apps on your list, your browser and Slack today, stay as you left them: a session opens, reads and closes none of them.
- PRs, comments and reports describe what a session saw in words, with no snapshot or screenshot attached.

## Where it fits

A core skill beside [agent-browser](../../skills/zerostarter/agent-browser/SKILL.md), its browser sibling from the same upstream.
The skill holds two rules itself until the `no-desktop-owner-app` hook is registered to refuse them too: `--headed`, and any command naming an app on your list.
A session trying it before it merges follows [.agents/skill-trial.md](../../.agents/skill-trial.md).
