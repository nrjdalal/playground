# agent-desktop

`agent-desktop` reads and drives desktop apps through the OS accessibility tree. The binary carries its own docs, matched to its version, so this skill holds only what the binary cannot know: whether this Mac lets you run it, and what stays the owner's. The desktop is the owner's own screen, so every step keeps your work **off the owner's hands**: nothing you do moves the owner's pointer, touches the owner's apps or carries what you saw outside your session.

## 1. Check

Run `agent-desktop version`, then `agent-desktop permissions`, which reads the grants and never prompts. Read each grant's `state` in its JSON, since `permissions` exits 0 with a grant denied.

- Accessibility reads `granted`, for every task.
- Screen Recording reads `granted`, when the task takes a screenshot (the binary's platform guide, Requirements).

macOS grants the app that launches agent-desktop. A factory session runs under the launchd herdr server (`~/.playground/bin/herdr`), not a GUI terminal, so that is the binary the grant most likely names (untested until the owner's first grant).

On a missing binary or a grant that is not `granted`, **stop** and tell your manager the one action needed: Ops installs `agent-desktop` (npm), or the owner grants the named permission to the launching app in System Settings, which your manager asks for as a `grant` decision (`.agents/dashboard/asks.md`) whose Approve opens System Settings at that pane. Your manager rechecks the grant after the Approve and tells you what it reads; once it reads `granted`, run `agent-desktop permissions` yourself and go on. Granting is the owner's step, and so are `permissions --guide` and `permissions --request`, which open System Settings or a system prompt on the owner's screen.

Done when `version` answers and each grant the task needs reads `granted`, or when your manager has the stop and its one action.

## 2. Load the binary's docs

Run `agent-desktop skills get desktop` and `agent-desktop skills get platform` once in the session, and follow them: they hold the observe, act, verify loop and macOS's own rules.

Done when both have printed in this session.

## 3. Stay headless

Use the default headless mode. `--headed` sends physical pointer and key events, which move the owner's own pointer and focus, so it is the owner's alone: when a task needs it, tell your manager the one command for the owner to run with `!`. The `no-desktop-owner-app` hook refuses `--headed` in every session, and its refusal names that same route.

A task that needs a window reads the screen lock first, `ioreg -n Root -d1 | grep CGSSessionScreenIsLocked`: while the screen is locked every window read times out for every app (`launch --activate` fails with "CoreGraphics window inventory deadline elapsed"), so such a task runs only while the screen is unlocked. When the target app already runs with no window, a headless `agent-desktop launch` or a background `open -g` of its pane makes none, so there is no tree to act on (measured on System Settings). Such a task takes `launch --activate`, which takes the owner's focus, so it runs only when the owner is present and has said yes to the focus change, or as the owner's own action; the brief says so before the worker starts. With that yes, it activates only in an idle window: `HIDIdleTime` from `ioreg -c IOHIDSystem` at 1800 s or more, read again just before the activate, and the task stops, cancelling any open sheet and closing the app, once idle drops under 60 s.

Done when every command in the session runs headless, or a task that needs a window ran unlocked, with the owner's yes, in an idle window.

## 4. Leave the owner's apps alone

Name only apps off the owner's list in a snapshot, act, launch or close, matching a name in any case and with or without `.app`. Read the list with `bun "$PLAYGROUND_REPO/packages/scripts/src/playground/guard-list.ts" no-desktop-owner-app desktop-owner-apps`, which prints it as JSON. On any answer that is not a printed list (an exit 2, an unset `$PLAYGROUND_REPO`, no `bun`), **stop** and tell your manager, since there is no list to trust. The owner's login extension fills the list, which changes only by the owner's Approve on an `apps` decision your manager posts (`.agents/dashboard/asks.md`); the `no-desktop-owner-app` hook refuses a command that names a listed app, its refusal naming the two routes: the owner runs the command with `!`, or takes the app off the list.

Done when every app the session's commands name is off the list the reader printed.

## 5. Keep desktop content private

A snapshot, screenshot, clipboard read, trace or command output can hold whatever is on the owner's desktop. Keep each one in your session's scratchpad, and describe results in words wherever they go out: a commit, PR, issue, comment, Inbox item, Slack post or report carries words alone, with no snapshot, screenshot or quoted desktop text. Delete the scratchpad copies when the task ends.

Done when no outward write holds a desktop artifact, its path or quoted desktop text, and the scratchpad copies are deleted.

## Keep the skills learning

When you get past a hurdle this skill did not foresee, find a fix, or find a faster way, tell the `dispatcher` session: `SendMessage` to `dispatcher` with what happened, what worked, and which step it belongs in, in a few plain lines. That session turns findings into a reviewed change to the factory's repo. When `ListAgents` lists no `dispatcher` session, end your report with the finding instead, so the owner can pass it on. A finding never carries desktop content, prod data, secrets or customer details.
