# Comments, inline findings and threads

Every body goes to a file in your scratchpad in one call and is posted in a separate call, with a literal absolute path (the comment-wording hook reads the file, and refuses a path held in a shell variable). Write it with the Write tool, or with a heredoc whose delimiter is quoted (`<<'EOF'`), the inline review's JSON file the same way. A review's comment text quotes probe commands, and an unquoted heredoc runs them: on 1 Nov, a reviewer fed python3 its inline review JSON through an unquoted heredoc, the backticked probe commands in the comment text ran as command substitutions, and one, a folder delete, took `scripts/` and `skills/` out of its review clone, which a checkout restored. Write "ship" or "publish step" where the word for cutting a version would go (the **comments** rule). When the PR's own text holds that word (a line format, a command, a quoted rule), paraphrase it in the comment rather than quote it, as "the grouped prod-deploy line" stood for end-of-day's line on one PR: the hook refuses a quote all the same. Describe the hook as "the hook that refuses the publish-step word" and its test file as "the comment hook's test file", never by either path: each path holds the word, and a comment that cites one is refused and lost. Every SHA, time or count in a body or a command's argument (a verdict, an inline review's `commit_id`, a thread reply) comes from the command that produces it, copied whole from that command's output, never typed from memory or padded out from a short SHA; step 7's `state.py pr` read then confirms the head the verdict names. A write that times out, errors or is killed may have landed: read the PR's comments, threads or reviews before posting again, and go by what is there.

Every session shares one GitHub account, and with it one GraphQL budget (`gh api rate_limit --jq .resources.graphql`). REST has a budget of its own: the verdict and the inline review always post over it (below), and when GraphQL is spent, so does a PR body, with `gh api -X PATCH repos/<repo>/pulls/<n> -F body=@<file>`. With GraphQL spent, `state.py pr` and `scan` read over REST and say so, listing every review thread with its resolution unknown, since only GraphQL knows it: treat each as open until the reset lets you check. Closing threads needs GraphQL and waits for the reset, and the verdict names the threads still open.

## The verdict comment

One new comment per round, never an edit of an earlier one: the record of what was said at which SHA is the point. Post it over REST, which spends no GraphQL (playbook's **github** rule): `gh api repos/<repo>/issues/<n>/comments -F body=@<file> --jq .html_url`. Its first line is the gate's, exactly:

```
## ReviewBot · round <r>: <s>/5 at <sha7> · <b> blocking, <f> should-fix, <k> nits
```

On an outside author's PR, the verdict also carries need, hit and factory lines ([CHANNEL.md](../../../../../extensions/core/skills/playbook/CHANNEL.md)).

Then, in this order:

- **Spec** (the right thing): every spec line from step 3, marked delivered, partial or missing with where, then each finding as `- [blocking|should-fix|nit] path:line: what is wrong. Fix: what to do. (measured|reasoned)`, quoting the spec line it answers. For a finding that asks for a behaviour, `Fix:` states the behaviour wanted, not only the defect, so the fix cannot be read the other way. When the ticket carries samples, your samples table from step 4 follows, every row at this head. Keep the two axes apart, never merged or re-ranked, so one cannot hide the other.
- **Standards** (built well): the same shape, citing the rule (`AGENTS.md`, a skill, your brief) or naming the smell as a judgement call.
- **Threads**: how many you closed and at which commit, and how many stay open.
- **Checked** and **Not verified**: what was read in full, skimmed and run (VERIFY.md).
- On a 5/5 that was a candidate: one line saying the fresh full read found nothing blocking or should-fix, its nits listed above for the worker to take or leave.
- Last line: `ReviewBot · round <r>. Push back on any finding you think is wrong.` The account is shared, so this line, not the author field, says who wrote it.

A round on a base merge alone says so in one line under the header (`Base merge only: the PR's own work is unchanged since <sha7>.`), keeping the PR's standing score.

Fill the verdict file's blanks with Edit or Write, each fill a call of its own, and right before the post grep the file for every slot the template above holds (`grep -nE '<(r|s|sha7|b|f|k)>' <file>`, plus any slot of your own, such as `<checks>`), posting only when it prints nothing: one verdict posted with its checks slot still in it, after the hook that refuses the publish-step word stopped the one call that both filled the slot with sed and posted a reply.

With each verdict, first give its `Review • <s>/5` label its score's color, which creates the label when missing and recolors it otherwise: `gh label create 'Review • <s>/5' -R <repo> --color <hex> --force`, `<hex>` being the table's color without its `#`, written in the command itself.
Then set the PR's `Review • <s>/5` label and remove any other `Review • ` label, over REST as the verdict posts (`gh api repos/<repo>/issues/<n>/labels -f 'labels[]=Review • <s>/5'`, then `gh api -X DELETE repos/<repo>/issues/<n>/labels/<label>` for each other, its name URL-encoded: `Review%20%E2%80%A2%203%2F5`), so the labels carry the newest score alone.

| Label          | Color     |
| -------------- | --------- |
| `Review • 5/5` | `#22c55e` |
| `Review • 4/5` | `#f97316` |
| `Review • 3/5` | `#ef4444` |
| `Review • 2/5` | `#ef4444` |
| `Review • 1/5` | `#ef4444` |

## Inline findings

Each finding with a line in the diff also goes on that line, as one review per round; a round scoring below 5 posts its nits there too.
A 5/5 verdict's nits stay in the verdict alone, with no inline thread, since [The last 5/5](../SKILL.md#the-last-55) is done only once every thread you opened is resolved.
Post the review with:

```bash
gh api repos/<repo>/pulls/<n>/reviews --input <file.json>
```

```json
{
  "body": "ReviewBot round <r> inline findings at <sha7>; the verdict is the round's comment.",
  "comments": [
    {
      "body": "<finding>. Fix: <fix>.\n\nReviewBot · round <r>",
      "line": 42,
      "path": "a/b.ts",
      "side": "RIGHT"
    }
  ],
  "commit_id": "<head, all 40 characters>",
  "event": "COMMENT"
}
```

- `event` is `COMMENT`: the PR's author is this same account, so GitHub refuses `APPROVE` and `REQUEST_CHANGES`.
- Anchor only to a line inside one of the diff's hunks (added or context); any other line fails the whole call with a 422. A finding on an untouched line stays in the verdict alone.
- A finding on a file under the ship skill's folder goes inline with the file's real `path`: the comment-wording hook reads only bodies, so a `path` field alone never trips it. That comment's body, and the verdict, name the file by role and bare name ("the ship skill's step 5, SKILL.md"), never with its folder: the folder's name is the publish-step word itself, and a body holding it is refused and lost.
- Sign every inline comment with `ReviewBot · round <r>` as its last line: each is read on its own in Files changed, and `state.py` knows a thread as yours by that word.
- The review's `body` never starts with `## ReviewBot`, so no reader takes it for the verdict.

## Closing threads

After posting, close every thread of yours the head settles; the open list holds only live work. For each thread `state.py pr` lists:

- **Fixed at the head** (checked in the code, never taken from a reply): reply with the commit that fixed it and resolve, in one mutation.
- **The author replied and is right**: say so in one line, and resolve; "is right" means you reproduced the author's reason with one command and named that command in your reply.
- **The author replied and the finding stands**: reply with the measurement again, rather than the claim, and leave it open.
- **The fix revealed a different problem**: resolve the old thread and open a new one for the new finding.
- **A nit thread from an earlier round that the worker left**, in a round that scores 5/5: list the nit in the verdict, and resolve.

With GraphQL spent, reply over REST to the thread's first comment, which `state.py pr` then names as `comment <id>`: `gh api repos/<repo>/pulls/<n>/comments/<id>/replies -F body=@<file>`; resolving waits for the reset. Otherwise write the mutation to a file, at most 8 threads to a mutation, then run `gh api graphql -F query=@<file>`; when one fails partway, read the threads again (`state.py pr`) before the retry, since some already took their reply or resolve. Its reply names no skill, session or Playground term, since the no-playground-leak hook cannot place a repository from node ids and refuses it; say "another skill" instead:

```graphql
mutation {
  a: addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(
    input: {
      pullRequestReviewThreadId: "PRRT_..."
      body: "Fixed in <sha7>: <how>.\n\nReviewBot · round <r>"
    }
  ) {
    clientMutationId
  }
  b: resolveReviewThread(input: { threadId: "PRRT_..." }) {
    thread {
      isResolved
    }
  }
}
```

Done when every thread `state.py pr` lists is resolved or named in the verdict as still open.
