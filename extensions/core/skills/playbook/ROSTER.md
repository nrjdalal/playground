# Roster

`~/.playground/roster.json` (in `$PLAYGROUND_DATA_DIR` when it is set) is the factory's record of every session: its kind, role, task, short title, ETA, where its work went and its last report.
The dashboard reads it through `api/hono/src/lib/dashboard/roster.ts`: the sidebar each agent's title and, on a working, fixing or stuck worker's hover, the time left to its ETA, and the dashboard every agent's title, task, branch, pull request and last report for its Agents table, an `ended` status as Ended,
and the backlog entries still waiting (from `backlogNext` on, less those `backlogTaken` lists) as its Next up list, `Fix: ` entries first, then `<owner>: ` entries, then the rest, each oldest first.
`scripts/roster.ts` in the main checkout is its only writer: atomic writes, `updatedAt` and `lastReportAt` stamped from the UTC clock, titles cut to 40 characters with any trailing `(#N)` dropped, since the PR is linked on its own.

The dispatcher or the lead that starts a session, dispatches to it, hears its report or ends it writes that change, at that moment; workers and runners report and leave the writing to their lead, except a worker's branch, which the worker writes itself at its first push (It pushes its branch, below), since no report carries it before its PR opens.
`scripts/spawn.sh` writes what it knows as it starts a session, whoever runs it: its `kind`, its `workspace`, a column's `surface`, a worker's or checker's `title`, a checker's `worker=` and, for an entry that holds neither a task nor a pr, a `task`: its brief's file name, else its role and name (`probe probe-api`).
A new probe's `title` defaults to `Probe: <name>` and a new runner's to its own name while its entry holds none, so neither row reads its first ask.
Each lead's sweep ends its own down agents, and Ops keeps the rest of the file in order.

Run each row as `bun <main checkout>/scripts/roster.ts <row>` (`$PLAYGROUND_REPO` names the main checkout in a session spawn.sh started):

| When                          | Row                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A session starts              | `assign <name> "<title>" "<task>"`, `<title>` the one spawn.sh wrote; the session's herdr pane label carries its name, so the entry holds no `workspace` or `surface`                                                                                       |
| A respawned session starts    | `set <name> status=working`, so the entry's `pr`, `branch` and `eta` carry over (a cmux restore respawn)                                                                                                                                                    |
| A worker spawns a checker     | `assign <checker> "<title>" "<task>" pr=<PR url>`, `<title>` the `Review: ` or `Test: ` one spawn.sh wrote, beside the `worker=` spawn.sh wrote, so the dashboard nests the checker under its worker                                                        |
| A checker takes another PR    | `assign <checker> "Review: <its new worker's title>" "<task>" worker=<worker> pr=<PR url>` (`Test: ` for a tester), adding `repo=<owner/name>` for a repo other than the factory's (`factory.repo`), which moves its worker, pr, repo and title in one step |
| A worker takes an item        | `set <name> size=<small\|medium\|big>`, plan.json's `size` for its item (a work-org ticket medium unless its lead says), which its runs and its checkers' count in load units ([rules/slots.md](../../rules/slots.md))                                      |
| A runner takes another job    | `set <runner> task="<every job, each with its log and health check>"`                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| A runner's cadence is set     | `set <runner> schedule=always`, or `schedule="<5-field cron>"` (`"0 5 * * *"`), which its Dashboard row ends with (`every day at 5:00 AM`)                                                                                                                  |
| It sends an ETA               | `set <name> eta=<iso>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| It pushes its branch          | `set <name> branch=<branch>` at its first push, before its PR opens, so ops-sweep tells its lead when 15 minutes pass with no PR                                                                                                                            |
| It opens a PR                 | `set <name> pr=<PR url> branch=<branch> repo=<owner/name>`                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| It reports                    | `report <name> "<one line>" eta=<iso>`, the ETA the report carried                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Its PR merges                 | `report <name> "merged <sha>" eta=`, which clears its ETA                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| It ends                       | `report <name> "<why it ended>" status=ended`; a herdr session's `spawn.sh close` has already set `ended`, so its report is `report <name> "<why it ended>"`                                                                                                |
| It posts an Inbox decision    | `set <name> asks="<every open id, space-separated>"`                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| A task waits for a slot       | `backlog "<task>"`, with `<owner>: ` or `Fix: ` in front of a priority task (below)                                                                                                                                                                         |

- `surface` is the session's own split and `workspace` the workspace that holds it ([SESSIONS.md](SESSIONS.md#spawn)): a worker's checkers and probes share their worker's `workspace`, each with a `surface` of its own, and the managers share the `Managers` workspace.
  Every command aimed at one session names both.
  A session started before the `surface` key has a `workspace` alone until its next restart.
- `assign` clears the previous task's `pr`, `branch`, `repo`, `ticket`, report and `eta`, so an agent's next chore starts clean.
  A new task on an agent holding a `pr` goes through `assign`: `set` refuses `task=` there, naming `assign`; `set <name> title=<title>` renames the row and leaves its `pr`, `branch` and `repo` alone.
  A checker's `pr` or `worker` moves only through `assign`, given both `worker=` and `pr=`: `set` and `report` refuse any move of either, and `assign` one given alone, naming `assign`, since a checker left on its old worker keeps that worker's ended row in the sidebar.
- `status` takes one word from `scripts/roster-statuses.json`: a `live` word while the session runs, a `finished` one once it stops, which ops-report reads so it never calls a finished session down.
  Progress text goes through `report <name> "<text>"` as `lastReport`: `set`, `report` and `assign` refuse any other `status`, naming `report`, and a row already holding text keeps it until its next `status=`.
- `pr` holds the PR's full URL, since the dashboard and code-review-loop's recovery scan read no other form.
  A bare number (`1561`, or the same with a leading `#`) is expanded to `https://github.com/<repo>/pull/<n>`, `<repo>` being the same call's `repo=`, else the entry's, else `factory.repo`; any other value is refused.
- `eta` is the UTC time a worker last told its lead it expects its chore done (the **eta** rule).
  `set`, `report` and `assign` refuse any `eta=` that is not a future `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` time, naming the recipe (`date -u` plus the estimate), and an empty `eta=` clears it.
  The lead writes the worker's own time, since the dashboard counts down to it and shows nothing once it passes; a worker that has sent none has none.
  A runner carries none.
- `kind` says what a session is, whatever its name: `worker`, `researcher`, `reviewer`, `tester`, `runner` or `probe`, or a manager's `builder` (`builder`), `ops` (`ops`), `planner` (`planner`), `optimizer` or `dispatcher` (the dispatcher, dispatcher-2).
  spawn.sh writes it at every start and reads it on a resume, and the dashboard, the hooks, the optimizer and the Usage app read it before the name's prefix, so a name such as `k3v9q2-reviewer` places as its kind says.
  An off-list kind is refused.
  The role follows from the kind when the agent is first written (`manager` for builder, dispatcher, ops, optimizer and planner, `runner` for runner, `worker` for the rest), else from the name's kind (`kindOfName`: `k3m9px-runner` and `runner-*` are `runner`, `x7mh4d-builder` is `manager`), and a name with no kind is `manager` for `dispatcher` and `worker` for the rest.
  `backfill` gives each entry with no kind the one its name's prefix gives, once.
- `who <kind>` prints the session holding a manager kind's seat (`builder`, `ops`, `planner`, `optimizer`), writing nothing: of the entries of that kind (its `kind`, else its name's, an `<id>-<kind>` suffix or today's name), the newest whose status is not `ended`, `parked` or `starting`, else the newest `starting` one, else today's name (`builder`, `ops`, `planner`, `optimizer`).
- `who dispatcher [1|2]` prints the dispatcher holding a slot the same way, 1 the primary (Alpha, the default) and 2 the second (Bravo), by the entry's `slot` (spawn.sh writes `slot=2` for a second dispatcher it opens), else today's name's slot, else the first; else the dispatcher or dispatcher-2.
  It takes the slot's number, never its label.
  Each reader of a manager goes through it or its rule (`managerOf` in `packages/config/src/kinds.ts`): spawn.sh's reports-to, notify.sh's default and kind words, and the backlog marks below.
  Write "your builder" in a brief and resolve it with `who builder` when you send it.
- A runner under another name (a headless job such as `nightly-digest`) is recorded with `kind=runner` on its `assign`, which places it as a runner whatever its name.
- A new name needs a task, since the dashboard's schema drops an agent with none: `set` and `report` refuse a name the roster lacks unless `task=` gives one, and `assign` gives it as its third word.
- A name is lowercase words joined by `-`, spawn.sh's word shape: `set`, `report` and `assign` refuse any other, naming it, before they read or write the roster.
- The backlog only grows until roster.ts can take an entry off it, so the builder (`who builder`, `builder` today) keeps two marks on its own entry, where the dashboard reads them: `backlogNext` (0-based, 0 when unset), below which every entry is settled, and `backlogTaken`, the space-separated indices at or past it that are settled already (dispatched, folded into a lane or dropped).
  A priority entry is marked by its prefix alone: `Fix: ` for a fix to live breakage or security, `<owner>: ` (the owner's name, `PLAYGROUND_OWNER_NAME`) for a task that quotes the owner's own words asking for it.
  When a slot opens:
  1. A held checker ([SWEEP.md](SWEEP.md)) takes the slot first, since its review frees a worker's slot sooner than a new chore fills one.
     Else, among the entries at or past `backlogNext` that `backlogTaken` does not list, take the oldest `Fix: ` entry ready to dispatch, else the oldest work-org entry (a work-org ticket, which stays outside the lanes); with neither, take the next item of the first lane, in `plan.json`'s order, that has no worker and is not `listedOnly` ([DISPATCH.md](DISPATCH.md)).
     The Planner folds every other entry, Playground's own work, into a lane, a `<owner>: ` entry ahead of the factory's own, and tells the Builder each index it folds, which is settled then.
     A task still waiting on something stays for a later slot or fold.
  2. Add each index taken or folded to `backlogTaken`, then move `backlogNext` past every leading entry that `backlogTaken` lists or that is no task at all (a note), and drop the indices below it from `backlogTaken`: `set <builder> backlogNext=<n> backlogTaken="<indices>"`.
     A builder respawned under a new name writes both marks on its own entry with its first `set`.

  An entry dispatched any other way (out of turn by the dispatcher, or as a runner job by Ops), or dropped as done or obsolete, is settled the same way: whoever settles it tells the builder its index, and the builder, the marks' only writer, adds it to `backlogTaken` and makes step 2's move.

  An entry whose issue is filed is settled too, since its work lives in the issue now: `backlog-done` puts `[#<issue>] ` in front of it, which also takes a `Fix: ` or `<owner>: ` entry out of Next up's priority groups, and whoever runs it tells the builder its index the same way.

- `asks` on the dispatcher's or a lead's entry lists the Inbox decisions it posted and has not yet acted on.
  A read mark (`bun run --cwd <dashboard checkout> ask get <id> --ack`) says an answer reached the asker, not that it was acted on, so the list stays; a go closes only with `bun run ask ack <id> --link <url>` or `--no-link "<why>"` once carried out (the **ask** rule).
- Pass no `updatedAt` or `lastReportAt`: roster.ts stamps them.
