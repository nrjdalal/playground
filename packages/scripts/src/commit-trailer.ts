// AGENTS.md's Commits rule keeps a Co-authored-by trailer out of every commit: commit-msg runs this on the message file, which drops each such line, in any case, and says so, so the commit goes through on its first try; with `--push` pre-push refuses a pushed commit no remote holds yet whose message holds one, since a commit made with --no-verify skips commit-msg, and names the amend that drops it. The same push step refuses such a commit whose message, or a pushed ref whose name, holds a term from no-public-leak's list, by sha or ref and kind alone.
