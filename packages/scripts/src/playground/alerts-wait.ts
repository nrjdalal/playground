// playground alerts-wait <name>: a session's background wait on the outbox, so it wakes within a second or two rather than after the relay's own turn (74s measured on 26 Oct, against the owner's 30s). It reads every job queue in the outbox (ops-<job>.jsonl, where notify.sh and each job queue their lines, a session's own hook its stuck alerts and ops-tick's relay watch its late-stop line), the stuck alerts first, from byte cursors of its own per name, prints the first new line addressed to the name, and exits; Ops' drain still sends every line from its own cursor.json, as the backstop. It keeps its pid in alerts-wait/<name>.pid while it waits, so stuck-alert can tell a manager with no waiter from one with.
