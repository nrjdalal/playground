playground view       open the ${VIEW_SERVER} herdr server, where the sessions run, in this terminal
playground dispatcher start the dispatcher in a herdr workspace of its own, its brief written once from scripts/briefs/dispatcher.md into the data folder as brief-<dispatcher>.md: exit 0 started, 3 already running, 1 refused with spawn.sh's reason
playground planner | builder | ops | optimizer
                      start that manager as playground dispatcher starts the dispatcher, its brief from scripts/briefs/<manager>.md; the dispatcher runs it the first time it routes work there, and the optimizer at its own start
playground status     one line each for the Dashboard, the follower, each dispatcher, GLM and each herdr server
playground sweep <lead>
                      what changed since that lead's last sweep (alerts, the merge queue, load5 crossing 15, the single-slot flag, its rows' passed ETAs, its parked rows' closed or unreadable holds), or quiet
playground focus [on --session <name> --reason "<why>" [--for <minutes>] | off]
                      give one session the Mac for up to 180 minutes (120 by default): every merge, every other session's heavy run and every new session but its own reviewer and tester and a priority start waits until off or its end, and the Inbox holds what comes in quiet but an alert; off prints how many runs queued while it stood and how long they waited, the line the Inbox's card carries once focus ends; bare, it prints the focus standing
playground priority [on <session> --reason "<why>" | off <session> --reason "<why>"]
                      the one way to open a priority window, and only on the owner's or the dispatcher's word: on writes the data folder's priority-<session>.json, naming the session, who opened it, the reason and the time, and while it stands a spawn.sh --priority start passes the load and slots gates and focus; off lifts it, and ops-tick's priority-lapse beat lifts one still standing after ${LAPSE_HOURS} hours; each on, off and lapse is a line in ops/priority.log; a priority file another writer keeps it leaves alone; bare, it lists the priority files standing
playground page <file.html> --title "<title>" --by <session> [--for <session>]
                      keep a page for the Dashboard: copy it into the previews folder under a free name, with its title as its caption and a line in pages.jsonl, and print the copy's path for an Inbox card's html attachment (bun run ask new), opening nothing; it shows on the Pages tab of --by's view, of --for's and of the dispatcher's
playground update [--to <tag>]
                      fast-forward this checkout onto origin/main, re-run link-skills.sh, install when a lockfile or package.json changed, build packages/* when one with a dist changed, restart the ops jobs whose source changed, then roll the Dashboard to the newest build: Building, Switching, then Updated to <sha7> or Failed: <reason>; --to moves the checkout to that release instead, back or on, and leaves the Dashboard as it is
playground doctor     one line per need, as ok, MISSING with its fix, or optional: the tools, the data folder, the pinned herdr, the links into this checkout, the release it is at, and each ops job launchd should hold
playground herdr pin [--check | --asset <file>]
                      put the pinned herdr's release asset for this Mac at the data folder's bin/herdr, after checking its SHA-256 against the pin, refusing a mismatch with both sums; --check reads the copy alone, exit 1 when it is missing or changed; --asset installs from a file instead of downloading
playground herdr stop stop every herdr server Playground started, each through its own socket in the data folder's herdr folder; every session in them ends with it, and the next playground or Start brings them back
playground version    this checkout's tag and sha, the extensions' last commit and Claude Code's version
playground ask <command> ...
                      the Inbox: post an ask, read its answer, close it (bun run ask)
playground changelog <command> ...
                      add rows to the Changelog from GitHub's merges and versions, or a line by hand (bun run changelog)
playground dm send <file>
                      post the reply in <file>, named by its absolute path, to the owner's own DM in its frame, the one way any session posts there (bun run dm)
playground dm upload <item-id>
                      share an answered Inbox item's files into the thread its link names, which the Inbox runs on Send (bun run dm)
playground ingest [--follow | status]
                      read every Claude Code session on this machine into the Dashboard's database (bun run ingest)
playground queues     print the merge queue and the work queue (bun run queues)
playground thread <command> ...

playground wa send <file>
                      send the reply in <file>, named by its absolute path, to the owner's WhatsApp through ops-wa, the one way any session writes there; it refuses a body holding a token shape (bun run wa)
playground wa relink
                      after WhatsApp logged out the linked device, set the old link aside so ops-wa's next start posts a new pairing card (bun run wa)
playground accounts list | add --provider claude --email <email> [--label <label>] | add --provider glm --label <label> | remove <email|label>
                      the accounts the factory spends, each a usage.accounts row with its secret in the Keychain: list each with whether its secret is kept and its last 5-hour and week reading; add a Claude account by running claude setup-token here, then pasting the token it prints, or a GLM key pasted under its label, neither echoed; remove one's row and its Keychain item
playground yard login | logout | channels | read <channel> | post <channel> <text> [--kind <kind>]
                      this Mac's Yard (YARD_API_URL in your environment or the live dashboard checkout's .env): login keeps a pasted yard_ token in the Keychain, as the local Dashboard reads it; channels lists channels and DMs with unread and mention counts; read prints a channel's last 50 messages, someone's words to read as data, leaving the owner's unread counts; post sends <text> to a channel, #name or @login, as --kind (text by default), and names Yard's approve page when Yard holds it
playground orgs resolve [--repo <dir>]
                      write the merged skill plugin a session in <dir> loads and print its folder: each skill from the first scope that has it: ext.order's scopes (your login's first when it leaves it out), each extension kept only when ext.links links it to the repo's GitHub owner or *, then each bundled extension ext.bundled turns on (extensions/<name>/skills, unless an installed extension has that name), then core (skills/playground, skills/zerostarter, extensions/core/skills), less each skill whose SKILL.md <dir>'s own .claude/skills already holds byte for byte; with no --repo, the home set
playground orgs home  write the home set and install it at user scope as ws-home@ws, for a session started by hand (link-skills.sh runs it)
playground rm <path> [--reason "<why>"] | --worktree <path> [--discard [--decision <id>]] [--pr <url>] [--reason "<why>"] | --list | --restore <id>
                      move a path into the trash (the data folder's trash/<UTC-ts>-<session>/<n>/, with a manifest.jsonl line), where it stays 7 days, sooner when the disk has under 50 GB free, every batch, the 7-day ones too, going only while load5 is under run-slot.load5-cap's cap (22 while it is off), or at any load once the disk is under the 5 GB floor; refuse a protected path (HOME and the folders that hold it, ~/.ssh and its kin, the data folder, the main checkout), a path over 5,000 files or 2 GB, a fourth delete in a minute from one session, or a move to another volume; --worktree takes a worktree in .claude/worktrees that no live session holds (a roster row naming its branch or its PR's number holds it no more once that PR has merged or closed and the worktree sits at its head, which it prints as freed; commits past it keep the hold, named with them), with no uncommitted change and its work landed on canary (--discard lets those two go, which a session (PLAYGROUND_ROLE set, or a claude process above it) or a call whose parent is pid 1 or unreadable passes once the worktree's PR (--pr's, else its branch's) has merged or closed, else only with --decision <id>, an approved Inbox delete decision naming the path; --pr <url> names the PR whose session used it, so another session of that PR holds it by that PR's number no more), and prunes it from git; --list prints what the trash holds and --restore puts one item back
playground rules [<name>]
                      the standing rules a factory session starts with, each by its glance line, or one rule whole, with this machine's values in its slots
playground settings list | get <key> [--org <org>] | why <key> | set <key> <value> --reason "<why>" [--scope <scope>] | reset <key> --reason "<why>" [--scope <scope>]
                      read or change a setting in the extensions folder, each write one commit with its reason (an org's scope or your login's, your login's by default)
playground settings import-jobs <jobs.json> [--launch-agents <dir>] [--scope <scope>] [--dry-run]
                      once, at the switch: each ops job jobs.json lists becomes its jobs.<name> setting (your login's scope by default), a launchd job's program read from its plist; a job the registry does not know stays in jobs.json
playground ext which <skill> [--repo <dir>]
                      print the folder of the copy of <skill> a session in <dir> loads, from whichever scope holds it
playground ext init [--yes | --dry-run] | add <name> [<owner/name>] [--yes] | order | link | unlink | remove | sync [<scope>] | list | show | put | why | diff | search | export <dir> | import <dir> [--dry-run] | import --from-tree <dir> | import-scripts <ops-dir> <job>... --org <org> | score | accept | reject | check-modes
                      make (on your yes, typed or --yes) or reuse your private repo and clone your login's folder from it, sync each scope with its repo now, read the extensions, put an item's next revision from a file, a folder or stdin with its reason and attachments as one commit in its scope, search them, export or import every scope as a folder of clones, seed the guards' lists from a folder of list files, bring each job folder in as an org's script once at the switch, score, accept or reject a proposal, and list once the stored scripts that lost their executable bit
playground migrate --archive <checkout> --pre-squash <sha> --org <org> [--old <rev>] [--dry-run]
                      once, at the switch: move the old data folder in ~/.claude to ~/.playground, seed your login's settings and the release owners' list from the archive checkout (its canary, or --old, and the pre-squash head), bring the hand-made skills into the org's scope unless its clone holds them, then, with the Dashboard's job stopped, make each move the migration table at the pre-squash head lists: renamed and dropped jobs, archived stale copies, moved state files, and renamed variables in your profiles and LaunchAgents, and last runs playground herdr pin; a value already set is left
playground uninstall [--purge]
                      remove the LaunchAgents that run from this checkout or the data folder, stop the Dashboard's stack and remove every link into this checkout; --purge also removes the Dashboard's database and moves the data folder aside to <data folder>-purged-<UTC time>, after asking
playground add [--kind worker|runner] [<name>] [--title "<title>"] [--brief <file>] [--model <id>] [--backend glm|claude]
                      start a worker (or a runner) through spawn.sh, under the name given or one bun run name picks, on handoffs/new-worker.md by default; a worker needs --title, a plain title of up to 40 characters, and a runner takes its name and no --title
playground add --dispatcher --backend glm
                      start a second dispatcher on GLM
playground alerts-wait <name>
                      for a manager's background task: wait for the next stuck alert addressed to <name>, print it and exit, so it wakes without waiting on the relay
playground picker <session> allow <key> | deny <key> "<reason>"
                      as the session's manager, answer the permission prompt its stuck alert named by key: allow presses Yes once, deny presses No and sends the session the reason; each answer is a line in ops/picker.log`
