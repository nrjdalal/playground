const USAGE = `Usage: bun run pr:merge <n> [options]

Squash-merges PR <n> into canary at its current head, and refuses unless every gate passed
at that head and the head is up to date with canary:

  open, ready   the PR is open and not a draft, or the owner's draft whose every other gate
                passes, which pr:merge marks ready (gh pr ready) just before it merges
  author        the repo's owner opened it, or --outside-author names who did
  held          ~/.playground/ops/report/held-prs.json does not list it (or
                PLAYGROUND_HELD_PRS); a file that does not read holds every PR
  base          it merges into canary
  up to date    canary has no commit the head lacks, or the head merges with canary clean;
                a conflict needs canary merged in, then checks and a 5/5 at the new head
  keeps canary  no merge of canary into the PR dropped a line canary added that git's own
                merge keeps and the squash still lacks, in a file that merges clean (a
                merge with -s ours drops them); blank lines, moves and rewrites pass, and
                it names each file and merge
  ci            every GitHub check on the head finished and passed, "Audit, Lint, and
                Build" and "test" among them; on factory.repo (the checkout's origin when unset) the head must carry a
                GitGuardian check, since a head it never started on ran no secret scan
  body          the PR body is the PR template the Changelog reads
  review        ## ReviewBot · round <n>: 5/5 at <sha7>, at the head

A gate reads only comments the repo's owner wrote; the newest review at the head wins, so a
lower score after a 5/5 refuses.

Merge-on-ready (bun run pr:train ready) merges the first gated PR in queue order.

It merges under the factory's merge lock (~/.playground/merge.lock, or
PLAYGROUND_MERGE_LOCK_DIR): one merge into canary at a time, every gate read inside it, and
the lock let go however it ends; a lock another PR holds refuses, naming it.

Options
  --explain       print whether the head merges clean with canary now and as which tree
                  (or the files it conflicts in), then each gate and what it found at the
                  head, and merge nothing
  --outside-author <login>
                  merge a PR that login opened, not the repo's owner: only on a lead's go,
                  once its read-only review and every gate have passed
  --repo <o/n>    the repo (default: the one gh sees from this checkout)
  -h, --help      this help`
