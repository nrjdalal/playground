const USAGE = `Usage: bun run trace-count [--write | --report | --swap | --lists [--since <base> [--branch <name>]]]

Counts each kind of private trace over the tree and fails when any count is over
packages/scripts/src/trace-count/counts.json, less each hit kept.json keeps on purpose.
--write lowers each count to the tree's.
--report lists each file holding a list value, with its hits per kind and "swap" on the
files the swap pass covers, and changes nothing. --swap gives each list value in those
files (tests, the API's fixtures, the replay fixtures) a made-up stand-in.
--lists counts the list kinds alone, as each commit's step does: with no list on this
machine it counts nothing, and it reads no settings, so it never exits 2.
With --since, as CI's list step runs it, it reads what the branch adds since its
merge-base with <base> instead (each changed file, a new file's path, each commit message,
and the --branch name), and names each hit by place and kind, never the term.
Exits 2 when no-public-leak's list is missing or a key of it is empty, or when
factory.archiveRepo or owner.names is unset, since their kinds would count nothing.`
