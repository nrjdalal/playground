// Stop hook, the inbox gate, and PreToolUse guard on AskUserQuestion: a session with a manager (PLAYGROUND_ROLE probe, reviewer, runner, tester or worker, else the roster's kind or the registry name, the hosted session aside) is refused the picker, since no one can answer one in its pane, and asks its manager by SendMessage. The gate: refuses a manager's stop while its final reply asks the owner for a decision or for their own action in chat, or keeps steps or a table the owner comes back to (keepsForOwner), until it is an item in the owner's Inbox (playbook's ask rule), so nothing the owner needs scrolls away in chat; steps or a table refuse the dispatcher's stop alone, since every other manager's reply is its report up the chain, which the dispatcher folds into the owner's card. It acts for the dispatcher and the leads (PLAYGROUND_ROLE lead, dispatcher or manager, else the roster's kind for the session's registry name, else that name), judges the hook input's `last_assistant_message` (the transcript can lag the turn's last message, ADR 0001), and refuses every stop that still asks, a lead's with the route up to the dispatcher, who posts it, `stop_hook_active` included, Claude Code's own cap on continuations in a row with no tool call between them bounding it. A reply naming an #iN passes once one of them reads open (or, for steps, is listed in the Inbox, as a progress card is) through bun run ask in the live dashboard's checkout; when none does, one it cannot read included, it fails closed for that reply. Anything else it cannot read lets the stop through.
