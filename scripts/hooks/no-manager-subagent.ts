// PreToolUse hook: refuses the Agent and Workflow tools to a manager (PLAYGROUND_ROLE lead, dispatcher or manager, else the roster's kind for the session's registry name, else that name, role.ts), since a manager hands every build, read or research to a worker session with a roster row. Workers, checkers and the owner's own sessions keep both tools, a reviewer's code-review sub-agents among them. Input it cannot read lets the call run.
