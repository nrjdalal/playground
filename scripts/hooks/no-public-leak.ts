// PreToolUse hook for the factory's sessions (role.ts), registered in both settings files: refuses a write to a public repository (a pull request, an issue, a review or a comment, through gh, gh api, curl or the GitHub MCP) whose text holds a name, a handle, a company term, a Slack id or a Linear key from its list, or an email address or an archive link, since everything written there is public once the repository is. Its reason names the kind of text, never the text; it reads every write as no-playground-leak does, through that guard's engine, and each kind as the trace ratchet counts it (packages/scripts/src/trace-count/kinds.ts).
