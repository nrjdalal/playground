// PreToolUse hook, acting for every session and sub-agent: refuses a recursive delete, an option that deletes the files a program reads, and the calls that strip a file's delete protection, since a recursive delete is final and a prompt line against one does not hold (2 Nov: two code-review sub-agents each deleted recursively in their own scratch folders), and names playground rm, which moves a path into a 7-day trash.
