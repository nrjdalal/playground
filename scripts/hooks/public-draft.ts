// The public-draft check, which `bun run ask new` and `edit` run on a draft with no link, a public post's (publicDraftRefusal in api/hono/src/lib/dashboard/public-draft.ts): `bun --no-env-file scripts/hooks/public-draft.ts <text>` exits 2 printing the refusal while the text holds a work figure (a count beside PR, pull request, commit or session) or an internal name, which the public rule keeps out of a public post, and 0 when it holds neither. The names come from the two leak guards' own finders (no-playground-leak's terms, roster and skills, and no-public-leak's kinds), so each name has one list; a ticket or PR number and the settings' repositories are this check's own. The refusal names the kind of text and its fix, never the text, and a list that cannot be read refuses as the guards do.
