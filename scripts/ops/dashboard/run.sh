# The live dashboard's ops job outside any Claude session: supervisor.sh (dev + follower as its children, rolls each canary
# merge), the off-loopback Docker watch, and a notifier that tells Ops (notify.sh) only about a FAIL,
# DOWN or ANOMALY line in results.log, a watch alert, or the supervisor exiting. Run it as a cmux terminal's command, from the dashboard's
# checkout. It follows its terminal: on SIGHUP, or once its parent has exited (the terminal is gone, as when cmux quits), it stops its
# stack by the recorded process groups (procs.sh, never by name), so a detached stack never keeps the portless names cmux then refuses.
