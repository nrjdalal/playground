# types into any pane: text typed into a pane lands as a user turn and reads as the owner's, and nothing sends a message on the owner's behalf.
# A manager kind (builder, ops, planner, optimizer) or dispatcher, the primary, names whoever holds its seat, by roster.ts who, which falls back to sessions.names; the kind word itself when roster.ts fails.
# The line goes to alerts.log and to ops/outbox/ops-<job>.jsonl as {at, job, to, text}; the relay, runner-plain-relay, sends each
# queued line with SendMessage, so it arrives as a cross-session message from the relay.
