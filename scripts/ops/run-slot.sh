# run-slot.sh <who> [--model-bound] [--after <pid>] -- <command> [args...]: run one heavy run (a suite, a type check, Checks, a build) holding one of the machine's run slots.
# A --model-bound run (one that mostly waits on a model, such as a parity replay) takes run-slot-model-<n> instead, at most slots.modelBound at once (model_cap, below), counted apart from the CPU slots and their queue.
# It takes ops/run-slot, run-slot-2, run-slot-3 or run-slot-4 by mkdir, as the load rules (lanes_open) open them and its size's load units fit, waiting and
# retrying while none does; writes "<who> <its own pid> <iso> <units> <size>" to the slot's .holder file beside it
# (a quick lane writes "<who> <pid> <iso>", the clone lane adding its two checkouts, clone_ends); runs the command as its
# child, in a new session and process group; and gives the slot back (rmdir) however it ends: success, failure or a signal. A holder whose
# pid has died is reclaimed; a slot whose holder line has no pid, or has no holder line, is held until it is 2 hours old, or while its age reads back empty. It prints the slot
# it took to stderr and exits with the command's code.
