"""ops-unstick: no factory session sits blocked unseen .

Every CYCLE seconds it reads the screen of every live Claude Code session herdr runs (`herdr pane list`, then
`herdr pane read --source visible` per pane), and matches the blocking states: the
usage-limit dialog, a permission prompt, a picker (AskUserQuestion, plan approval), the folder-trust and MCP-server dialogs, and
"Please run /login". The usage-limit dialog alone is answered, with Escape, and only while the usage file of the account the session's
resume record names, else the machine's own login, says it has room (and was written in the last 15 minutes: room());
it checks 5s later that the dialog cleared and no limit line before its reset
still shows. Nothing else is ever answered (no permission prompt is cancelled; the managers handle
it"): a limit dialog with no room sends a probe's block to its spawner alone (limit_targets), since the capped account's own line names every session on it to the builder and ops once a reset (capped_alert), and every other
block goes to the session's manager (alert_to), each through the outbox at first sight and every 10 minutes while it waits, naming the session, the dialog and how long it has waited, unless the session's own session-state hook
recorded it as stuck or failed (hook_owned), since that hook has told the manager already and ops-session-resume escalates it. During an account move (move.json in its state folder names the
dispatcher running it and an `until`), the per-session limit alerts wait and that dispatcher gets one summary line every 10 minutes.
A stall alarm tells the builder (it was dispatcher) when the
merge queue holds open PRs and no session has taken a turn in 10 minutes. state.json in its state folder (ops/unstick) lists what is blocked now. No model call; one instance (flock).
`--once` runs one pass in the foreground and prints it.
