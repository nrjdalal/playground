"""ops-up: start every ops job in jobs.json that is not healthy, and leave healthy ones alone.

A job ops starts in a terminal (one whose `runtime` names one, or that names none and sets `needsCmux`) runs as a pane of the Ops
workspace on the factory herdr server (the binary pin.json names, as spawn.sh reaches it). An old `runtime` of cmux or auto reads
as herdr, so a copy still running under cmux is stopped by its recorded pid and started in herdr on the next pass.

  up.py                      check every job once; start each unhealthy terminal job as a pane of herdr's Ops workspace
  up.py --once-per-cmux      does nothing: an old ~/.zshrc hook's call, which starts no pass
  up.py --restarted <a,b>    a plain pass, once any running pass ends, with those jobs' starts dropped first, so GRACE holds
                             back no job ops-restart stopped (packages/scripts/src/ops-restart)
  up.py --sessions           list, never run, the commands that bring the factory's Claude sessions back

Healthy means the job's heartbeat (ops/<name>.json) is fresh (within three cycles), its pid is alive, its last result
is not an exit and, for a terminal job, its pid runs under no cmux app (ptable.py). An unhealthy job's old herdr pane, which ops
opened, is closed first (ops-dashboard then waits until its recorded process groups are gone, stopping them through procs.sh);
nothing is ever selected by name or pattern. A launchd job is only reported: launchd keeps it alive. A job whose holder runs an
executable an update deleted, or whose heartbeat pid does while a holder or launchd holds it, (lsof, once a pass) is unhealthy: a
terminal job is stopped by its recorded pid and started again, a launchd job is reported once. A job that fails to start is logged
with herdr's whole answer and tried again on the next pass; only one that started waits out GRACE. Every pass exits 0.
