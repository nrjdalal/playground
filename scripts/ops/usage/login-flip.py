"""login-flip.py: say when the factory should move to another Claude account, and to which (dispatcher, 14 Oct:
the switch is the factory's, never an ask to the owner). It reads usage.json, which follows the stored login, and reads each other
account in ACCOUNTS that has a long-lived token in the Keychain (service usage.keychainService) from one 1-token call's rate-limit
headers, at most every 14 minutes. The current account is login-flip.json's `factory`, else the stored login. Ending accounts (ENDS) come first: the first usable one in ending_order() is the target whenever
the factory is on another account; with none usable, once the current login reaches its line, the renewing account with MIN_ROOM
whose week resets soonest. It names the target once ("switch due to ..."), or says once that no account has room. Prints nothing otherwise.
It also writes the split, each account's share of new sessions (week left per hour to its deadline), which spawn.sh's no-account default follows. --dry-run reads no token and changes nothing. State in login-flip.json in the state folder, ~/.playground/ops/usage."""
