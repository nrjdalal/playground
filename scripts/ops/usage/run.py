"""ops-usage: the usage windows of the account the factory spends into ~/.playground/usage.json, every 5 minutes, so the dashboard's
footer and tooltip read the account the sessions really run on, never a stale one.

The stored login (Claude Code's keychain item "Claude Code-credentials") is read from the endpoint Claude Code's /usage reads
(api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage) into usage/stored-login.json, which login-flip.py reads, and into usage-<local part>.json beside
usage.json, the file the dashboard's Week tooltip reads. It never refreshes that token (a refresh
rotates the refresh token Claude Code holds); an expired one waits for Claude Code to refresh it.
While login-flip.json names a `factory` account other than the stored login (the factory's sessions run on that account's token,
spawn.sh --account), usage.json holds that account's limits instead: login-flip's own reading of it, from one 1-token call's
rate-limit headers (a setup-token's inference scope cannot read /usage), taken here when login-flip's is 14 minutes old or more and
shared through login-flip.json, so the two never probe the same account twice in that time. usage.json then adds `readAt` (when the
limits were measured), `source` "token/ratelimit-headers" and `storedLogin` (the stored login's account and week). Remove `factory`
from login-flip.json when the factory moves back to the stored login. login-flip.json's `accounts` lists every account the factory's
sessions spend into; each is probed the same way, and usage.json's `accounts` holds each fresh week reading, which week-marks.py sums.
ops/alerts-usage.json holds, while each lasts, one alert per factory account whose week is past 90, 97 or 98% (usage.json's account
and each in its `accounts`), and the logged-in account's 5-hour window at 90% or more; ops-unstick folds it in.
Each alert's `name` is its account, since the leads' sweep keys an alert by its kind and name.
While login-flip.json names no `factory`, each Claude account the Dashboard's Add a Claude account keeps (usage.accounts, its
setup-token under usage.keychainService) comes before the stored login: usage.json holds the first one's probe reading, since the
dispatcher's sessions run on it, and the stored login's only when none of them reads. With neither a stored login nor an added account, the job beats "waiting", not an error.
usage.json's `rotation` is login-flip.json's: `pool`, each account login-flip.py switches between (its TARGETS), whether its plan ends, when, and the day of the month a renewing one renews.
usage.json keeps the shape the dashboard reads (rate_limits.{five_hour,seven_day}.{used_percentage,resets_at}, writtenAt), plus account
and source. No model call but that probe. One instance (flock).
