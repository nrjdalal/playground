"""week-marks.py: the week's marks per account, and the day's spend, across the factory's accounts (13 Oct: no daily cap,
"work if machine allows"). Reads ops-usage's usage.json, which names the account the Claude login holds and, in `accounts`,
each other account's week, keeps its own samples per account, and prints one status line plus:
  ALERT <90|97|98> <account> ...   once per account and week reset, when that account's week passes the mark: the logged-in
                                   account's, and each account in `accounts` that usage.accounts lists
  ALERT 5h ...                     once per 5-hour window of the logged-in account, when it passes 85%
Each other account in usage.json's `accounts` is sampled into account-samples.jsonl, and the status line adds their combined %/h. It sends nothing:
Ops' tick relays the alerts."""
