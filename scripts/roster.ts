  roster.ts report <name> <text> [key=value ...]    (sets lastReport, stamps lastReportAt; a new one needs task=)
  roster.ts assign <name> <title> <task> [k=v ...]  (new task, or a checker's next PR with worker= pr=, which joins its prs list; clears pr/branch/repo/owner/lastReport)
  roster.ts backlog <text>
  roster.ts backlog-done <index> <issue>            (marks the 0-based entry filed: "[#<issue>] <text>")
  roster.ts backfill                                (gives each entry with no kind the one its name's prefix gives)
  roster.ts who <kind>                              (prints the name holding a manager kind's seat; writes nothing)
  roster.ts who dispatcher [1|2]                    (prints the dispatcher in slot 1, Alpha, by default, or 2, Bravo; writes nothing)
  roster.ts who assistant                           (prints the live session the roster gives the assistant kind, else exits 1; writes nothing)
A checker's prs list holds every PR it serves, so auto-end keeps it while one is open: prs=<pr>,<pr> sets it, prs+=<pr> adds one, prs-=<pr> removes one, a PR not yet opened goes in as its issue's URL, and an extension item as <scope>/<kind>/<key>, which assign's pr= adds to prs alone; a checker whose worker is unset or ended takes a new PR through assign with a live worker= alone.
