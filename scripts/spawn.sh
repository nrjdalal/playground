# Spawns a factory session in herdr, the one way a factory session starts one
# (the no-raw-spawn hook refuses the rest). A capacity gate refuses, failing
# closed, unless five gates pass in order,
# the first failure naming its gate and its reading, every pass and refusal
# logged as one JSON line in ~/.playground/ops/capacity.jsonl, where the
# load gate reads the starts of the last 5 minutes back, with each slots.peers folder's own log's. The gates cap the machine's own room,
# and the sessions gate the live workers and checkers alone:
#   1. load, max(load1, load5) plus those starts under the core count (sysctl
#      hw.ncpu) times PLAYGROUND_LOAD_MULT (default 1.0), each start weighing
#      half its item's load units (small 1, medium 2, big 3: --size, else small
#      for a reviewer or tester, else what `ops/run-slot.sh size <name>` reads),
#      and a quarter of that cap kept for small items, so a big plan never blocks a small one,
#      a small worker keeping an eighth in its place for the reviewers and testers; a load at or over
#      that line refuses whatever the CPU's idle share, so the load stays under the cores, but for a
#      --priority start while a priority file stands (PRIORITY_FILE), logged as readings.priority,
#      a resume within 15 minutes of close ending a row that read live (JUST_CLOSED), logged as
#      readings.just_closed, and a manager's start or resume (role dispatcher or lead) while the
#      CPU reads 40% idle or more (top -l 2 -n 0), logged as readings.cpu_idle
#   2. memory, pressure level 1 or 2 (kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level) and
#      free at 8% or more (kern.memorystatus_level); a fresh worker start also needs swap-ins
#      under 100/s (vm_stat -c 2 1, gates.glmSwapinsMax), since free memory counts compressible
#      pages and read 62% on 7 Nov while 150 pages swapped in a second; every other start keeps
#      its pass, as at the slots gate
#   A GLM session takes its own load and memory gate in place of both:
#   load5 under 30, pressure level 1 and swap-ins under 100/s (vm_stat -c 2 1)
#   Under Claude Code's sandbox the load comes from uptime, and a refused pressure level leaves the swap-ins to decide (scripts/README.md)
#   3. slots, for a fresh worker start alone (a reviewer, tester or resume skips it, so work
#      already admitted finishes): `ops/run-slot.sh room`, refusing while runs wait in its queue and no
#      lane is free with the load units for a run (but for a --priority start while a priority file
#      stands, PRIORITY_FILE, logged as readings.priority), or when room gives no reading; a --reads-only
#      worker start passes it, logged as readings.reads_only, since it takes no lane
#   4. sessions, for a worker, reviewer or tester start while gates.sessionCap is set (0, the default, caps nothing):
#      the roster's rows reading starting, waiting or working named <id>-worker, -reviewer or -tester (or worker-, reviewer-
#      or tester- first), the starting name's own row and a row a --priority start marked (priority=1) left out, refusing at
#      or over the cap, logged as readings.sessions and readings.session_cap; a --priority start while a priority file stands
#      passes (readings.priority), and so does a resume of a row reading live (readings.counted), since the count holds it already
#   5. usage, the launching backend's own window: Claude reads usage.json
#      (5-hour under 90%, the week within 14.3 points a day of pace, floored at one day's share, readings
#      no older than 15 minutes; one never written, as on a fresh install before ops-usage first runs, passes,
#      its row reading it unread; a missing 5-hour window is an account with no 5-hour limit, read as none) and each other login's
#      usage-<name>.json or reading in login-flip.json's seen (the same checks, readings no older than 60 minutes); with no --account it
#      starts on the passing login next in the account split, else the one with the lowest week, naming it, and refuses
#      only when every login is over, its pick kept off the resume record's exec line so a restore picks afresh; a login whose usage.accounts
#      row is parked (parkedUntil a later time) counts as over, and an --account naming it is refused; --account skips the usage
#      check, since the other login's usage is not this machine's, but refuses a week a reading names at 100%; an --account naming
#      this machine's own login starts there, the split skipped, judged and refused as that login is in a bare start; GLM reads zai-usage.json
#      (the 5-hour window under 95% of its credits, with no week check, and no empty balance (its `balance`), valid only
#      while the zai usage job's last beat is ok and within 3 cycles)
#   The first dispatcher starts past every gate, by a manager start or a resume, so the owner always has one: the gates still read, a failure
#   logs a skipped row naming its gate and reading (which the load gate counts as a start) and prints it, and the
#   pass picks its login as for any start; every other manager start, an orchestrator's included, takes them all
# It also refuses a name a live session holds, since Claude Code would start the
# new one under a generated name. Every launch is in bypass mode, and drops
# inscope's own CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR where inscope exports one.

#   spawn.sh manager   <dispatcher|second dispatcher|optimizer|builder|ops|planner|orchestrator> <brief>   its own workspace in the main checkout's .claude/worktrees/leads: the first dispatcher (sessions.names' dispatcher), which works with the owner and reports to no session; the second dispatcher (Inbox #i520), sessions.names' dispatcher with -2 or an <id>-dispatcher it records as slot=2, on --backend glm or --account <a second account>; the optimizer (optimizer, an <id>-optimizer, or a session the roster gives the optimizer kind) and the builder, ops and planner (playground <manager> starts each), leads; these report to the first dispatcher; an orchestrator, a session whose roster row holds a manager kind of kinds.ts (ROSTER_ROLE_OF_KIND) and reportsTo, set first with roster.ts set <name> kind=<kind> reportsTo=<session>, a lead reporting to that session
#   spawn.sh resume    <name> <dir> [session-id]        reopens a closed session: in herdr in the pane herdr kept under its label while that pane holds no agent, else in a workspace of its own; with no session id, only in a folder it ran in; a <dir> in the Desktop folder resumes in the same tree under the code root, its transcript copied there when a session id is given; with no code root it resumes in the Desktop folder itself
#   spawn.sh restore                                    resumes every herdr session whose resume record (~/.playground/resume) names it on the server PLAYGROUND_HERDR_SESSION names (playground by default) and whose roster row is not done, ended, parked or paused, read again once its resume finds the session gone so a session closed mid-run stays down, each through `spawn.sh resume` and its gate with the --account its start was given, the --model it started with, for a reviewer or tester --pr with the PRs its roster row serves, and an --effort other than high; a live one is skipped, each record it passes over and each resume that fails is named with its reason, and one restore runs at a time; the first dispatcher's record runs first, then every other manager's, then the rest, a resume a gate's falling reading or focus holds prints as waiting (restore_waits), and a restore whose only misses wait exits 0, since a later restore brings them back
#   spawn.sh close     <name>                           closes the herdr pane spawn.sh opened for <name>, by the label it set, on the server its resume record names; it refuses any other pane and your own, and ends its roster row just before the pane closes, putting its status back when herdr refuses the close
#   --size <small|medium|big>  with any mode but restore or close, anywhere among its words: the item's size the load gate counts, in place of small for a reviewer or tester and the one ops/run-slot.sh size reads from the roster and plan.json for the rest
#   --check            with any mode but restore or close, anywhere among its words: run every check and gate but the live-name one, print "ok: <name> can start" and start or close nothing
#   --priority         with any mode but restore or close, anywhere among its words: the start passes the load gate, the slots gate's full queue and the sessions gate, its roster row marked priority=1 so it counts against no later start (the memory gate and an unread room still hold it) while a priority file stands in the data folder (priority.json, an urgent window, an org's own priority-<name>.json, its own urgent window, a session's own window that playground priority on opens, or priority-start.json, a job's own starts), and focus's refusal while any does; it is refused while none does.
#   --sandbox          with worker, probe or a reviewer's or probe's column alone, anywhere among its words: the session runs its shell commands in the closed sandbox, a probe's sandbox that also closes loopback, Keychain reads and the data folder's secret files, holds outbound hosts to the ones a worker's loop needs, and a worker or reviewer with no --in starts in a detached worktree made for it (review-<n> for this checkout's PR n, else <name>), whose folder, git entry and the main checkout's FETCH_HEAD, objects, refs and logs it writes, canary's, main's and live.branch's refs left shut; its roster row records sandbox=on, which a resume keeps and a start without it clears
#   --reads-only       with worker alone, anywhere among its words: the worker only reads (research, a fetch, an investigation) and runs nothing through run-slot, which its brief bars, so its start passes the slots gate; the load, memory and usage gates still hold it
#   --brief <file>     with resume alone, anywhere among its words: the resumed session's first prompt has it read ~/.playground/<file>; without it, a resume's first prompt has it act on the after-resume hook's instruction
#   --account <email>  with any mode but restore or close, anywhere among its words, and on a worker's, reviewer's or tester's Claude start while usage.accounts lists a Claude row, which the refusal lists in order: the session logs in as that Claude account, its token read from the Keychain (the service usage.keychainService names) by the new pane's own shell, which stops on an empty one before claude runs; this machine's own login starts on its config with no token, past the account split, its usage judged as a bare start's; with --backend glm it takes a GLM row's label instead
#   --backend glm      with any mode but restore, close or a reviewer's or a tester's, outside a checkout of an org ext.links guards and on a brief naming no word of the glm-refused-sources list, anywhere among its words: the session runs on Z.ai's GLM (models.glm, glm-5.3-flash by default) through Claude Code, its key read from the Keychain (the service models.glmKeychainService names, the account its usage.accounts row's label names: --account's, else the first GLM row's) by the new pane's own shell, which stops on an empty one before claude runs
#   --backend claude   the same places: the session runs on Claude (the default; named to set its pin on a fresh start)
#   --harness codex    with the first dispatcher's manager start or its resume alone, on a scratch data folder (PLAYGROUND_DATA_DIR naming one) until phase 3 lifts that, and no --backend, --account, --model or --effort: the session runs in Codex (the codex on PATH), its CODEX_HOME the data folder's codex/, whose config.toml, hooks.json (the factory's guards and the beat) and app-server-daemon/settings.json each launch writes; its hooks always run trusted (--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust), and it fails closed: a session whose SessionStart hook writes no beat within 60 seconds has its pane closed and the start refused, with no new pin, record or roster row (a resume keeps its earlier ones), and a pane herdr will not close is named for you to close; a Codex start also stops when PowerShell is installed (a pwsh or powershell on PATH, or /usr/local/bin/pwsh), which the beat names. The beat names its thread, which takes the session's name through codex app-server's thread/name/set.
#   --harness claude-code  the default: the session runs in Claude Code.
#     The harness and backend are recorded at the start in ~/.playground/backends/<name> (claude-code glm, codex openai), and carried on its resume, which also reads a pin of the backend alone: a resume takes no --backend or --harness while a pin stands, and refuses with no pin and none given, or with a pin that reads as none of those.
#   --model <id>       with any mode but restore or close, anywhere among its words: the Claude model, one of models.claude (claude-opus-5-5, claude-fable-5-1, claude-sonnet-5-5 and claude-haiku-5-5 by default), else models.default (claude-opus-5-5); never on GLM, which maps every model itself, and a reviewer or a tester runs on models.checker (claude-opus-5-5) alone. Nothing records it: a resume takes it afresh, so a resume with no --model runs on models.default.
#   --effort <level>   with any mode but restore or close, anywhere among its words: the session's effort, one of low, medium, high, xhigh or max, high by default; the resume record keeps one other than high, so a restore runs at the same effort, and a resume with none runs at high.
#   --title "<title>"  with worker or a reviewer's or tester's column, anywhere among its words: the plain title the sidebar reads the session by, up to 40 characters; a worker needs one, and a checker with none takes "Review: " or "Test: " before its worker's roster title
#   --pr <url>[,<url>]  with resume or a reviewer's or tester's column, anywhere among its words: the PRs the checker serves, each by its URL or its number alone, with an issue's URL beside a pull request for a PR not yet opened, or an extension item it scores as <scope>/<kind>/<key>; a reviewer's or tester's start is refused unless it names a pull request or an extension item, and its roster row records it before the pane opens; on an ended roster row it replaces the row's prs, and its pr with the first pull request named; on a live row, or none, it joins them and gives a row with no pr the first pull request named
#   --reports-to <session>  with worker alone, anywhere among its words: the session it reports to, named in its first prompt in place of the builder
#   --in <dir>         with worker alone, anywhere among its words: the folder the worker runs in, in place of this checkout: an existing folder under the code root (paths.codeRoot) or under ~/<org> for an org ext.links guards, any other refused
#   --memory <dir>     with any mode but restore or close, anywhere among its words: the launch runs with Claude Code's auto-memory on, writing to <dir>, an absolute folder: its built settings file, one of its own (factory-settings-...-memory-<name>.json), sets autoMemoryEnabled and autoMemoryDirectory, while every other launch's file stays as it is, for the auto-memory trial; --memory off launches with memory off on the shared file, whatever arm the role or the row would take
#   --runtime herdr    with any mode but restore or close, anywhere among its words: the session opens in herdr, on the playground server of ~/.playground/herdr (PLAYGROUND_HERDR_DIR and PLAYGROUND_HERDR_SESSION move it), by the binary its pin.json names alone; a column's anchor is then a herdr pane id (w1:p2, or lettered as wN:p1A), its spawner's own being $HERDR_PANE_ID. The session's name is at most 32 characters, herdr's limit for an agent's name.
#     With no --runtime, every start and resume opens in herdr, whatever terminal its spawner runs in.
#     The runtime is recorded at every start and resume in ~/.playground/runtimes/<name>, a resume rewriting whatever word the pin held.
#
# <name> is lowercase words joined by hyphens that give its kind: a new one from `bun run name <kind>` (<id>-<kind>), an old `<kind>-<words>` one, or a manager's own; the mode gives the kind, and a name that gives none or another is refused, but on a resume.
# <brief> is a file under ~/.playground. Every session runs at high effort unless --effort names another,
# on models.default unless --model names another of models.claude, or on models.glm with --backend glm. The first dispatcher reports to no one: its <reports-to> is the lead that briefs it.
# Each start lands in the roster.
