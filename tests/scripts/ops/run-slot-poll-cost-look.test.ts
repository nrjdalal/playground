// issue 1654: one look's process starts climbed with queue depth, 21 a ticket over a base of about 516 (measured at canary 628d629: 516 at depth 0, 936 at depth 20), because ordered_waiters paid a printf|cut and a stat per ticket and first_waiter paid a cat per ticket it walked, so a full folder made every look about twice the process starts of an empty one; this row bounds one head waiter's look beside 20 ranked tickets within a small margin of one beside none. The look's segment is counted from its trace, the external commands it runs and the subshells it enters, from look_mark to the sleep that ends it, since a time window would count the polls that land in it, which varies with the box's load
