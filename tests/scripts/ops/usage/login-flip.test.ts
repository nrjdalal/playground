// login-flip.py run whole under a scratch HOME at the clock given, with subprocess stubbed so no Keychain read or bun run ask runs, and beat's setting() answering ACCOUNTS as usage.accounts, the rule's factory_login and has_token the real ones beat.py carries. Accounts go by short names (ND, LW, ...) over made-up addresses: the harness writes the stored login and every reading into the state it finds, runs it, and names the switch's target (none when no account has room), the account it said the factory is now on, the accounts it kept in `accounts`, and the pool and split it wrote. spec.tokens names the short accounts whose Keychain read succeeds, every one of them unless it says otherwise, and urlopen refuses, so a probe that passes the Keychain gate still leaves the Mac unread
