The groups go in GROUP_ORDER; Dispatchers in the order the API names them (dispatchers), as the sidebar draws them; Orchestrators by byManagerOrder; Subagents, AI Runners and Other go by the state each row's icon draws (rowLines on its held light, its reviewers and testers counted as a check it waits on), a row waiting on you (at a card, or on an inbox item it posted) ranking with Stuck, then by byRowKey.
